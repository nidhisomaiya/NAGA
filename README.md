Your client is a medical research company, and you are asked to improve the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning. The goal of the project is to train a machine learning model which predicts whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
The dataset is composed of features computed from a digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.

We will follow this plan for our project:
I. Data Exploration 
II. Data Visualisation
III. Data Preprocessing
IV. Model Selection
V. Conclusion
